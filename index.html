                <h2>Understanding Lung Cancer</h2>
                <p>
                    Lung cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases worldwide. 
                    It often remains undetected in early stages due to mild or no symptoms, making 
                    treatment more challenging when diagnosed late.Early detection is critical 
                    for increasing survival rates.
                </p>

                <h2>How Our AI Model Helps</h2>
                <p>
                    Our AI-driven lung cancer detection system leverages deep learning models
                    to analyze chest X-ray images and detect patterns that indicate the presence of 
                    cancerous cells. The model is trained to provide fast, accurate, and non-invasive 
                    screening, assisting medical professionals in early-stage diagnosis.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Use AI for Early Detection?</h2>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li>✔️ High Precision – Advanced AI algorithms ensure accurate detection.</li>
                    <li>✔️ Instant Diagnosis – Get real-time results within seconds.</li>
                    <li>✔️ Non-Invasive – No need for complex procedures, just upload an X-ray.</li>
                    <li>✔️ Early Detection Saves Lives – Timely intervention improves recovery.</li>
                    <li>✔️ Personalized Health Tips – Receive expert lung care recommendations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Who Should Get Tested?</h2>
                <p>
                    Individuals with a history of smoking, persistent cough, shortness of breath, 
                    or frequent respiratory infections should undergo regular screenings. Our 
                    AI-powered tool helps with preliminary detection, but a medical 
                    consultation is always advised for confirmation.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Use This System?</h2>
                <p>
                    Simply upload a chest X-ray image , and our AI model will analyze it to 
                    predict whether the image shows signs of lung cancer or not. The result is 
                    displayed instantly, along with personalized health recommendations
                    to help maintain lung health.
                </p>
